Card games with CLI interfance and ability to train/play against RL agents.

This program was designed for a programming assignment. The assignment required three different RL agents to be
trained on an implementation of the card game Easy21. 

I wanted to try and make an extendable architecture for RL agents to be trained on a variety of discrete environments.
So that. is.. what... I.... did...... but at what cost!!!!!
